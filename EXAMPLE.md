## Note Features

### Frontmatter-Free Design
The plugin generates clean markdown without YAML frontmatter, making notes readable and easy to edit.

### Embedded Images
Poster images are automatically downloaded and embedded using Obsidian's `![[filename]]` syntax.

### Obsidian Links
The Letterboxd URI is included as a clickable link, allowing you to quickly access the movie page.

### Tags
CSV tags are converted to Obsidian hashtags, making them searchable and useful for queries.

### Rewatch Indicator
Movies marked as rewatches get a 🔁 emoji indicator.

### Rating Stars
Ratings are displayed with a ⭐ emoji for visual appeal.

### Notes Section
An empty "Notes" section is provided where you can add your own thoughts, reviews, or commentary about the movie.

## Customization

You can customize the output by modifying the settings in the plugin:

- **Output folder**: Change where movie notes are saved
- **Poster folder**: Change where poster images are saved
- **Download posters**: Toggle whether to download posters at all

## File Organization

By default, the plugin creates the following structure:

```
Your Vault/
└── Letterboxd/
    ├── posters/
    │   ├── The Matrix_1999.jpg
    │   ├── Inception_2010.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── The Matrix (1999).md
    ├── Inception (2010).md
    └── ...
```

This keeps all your movie data organized in one place while separating images into a subfolder.

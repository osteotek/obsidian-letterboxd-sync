## Note Features

### YAML Frontmatter
The plugin generates structured YAML frontmatter with all movie metadata, making notes compatible with Dataview and other Obsidian plugins. Includes title, year, rating, cover, description, directors, genres, cast, watched date, rewatch status, and Letterboxd link.

### Embedded Images
Poster images are automatically downloaded and embedded using Obsidian's `![[filename]]` syntax.

### Obsidian Links
The Letterboxd URI is included as a clickable link, allowing you to quickly access the movie page.

### Tags
CSV tags are converted to Obsidian hashtags, making them searchable and useful for queries.

### Rewatch Indicator
Movies marked as rewatches get a 🔁 emoji indicator.

### Rating Stars
Ratings are displayed with a ⭐ emoji for visual appeal.

### Notes Section
An empty "Notes" section is provided where you can add your own thoughts, reviews, or commentary about the movie.

## Customization

You can customize the output by modifying the settings in the plugin:

- **Output folder**: Change where movie notes are saved
- **Poster folder**: Change where poster images are saved
- **Download posters**: Toggle whether to download posters at all

## File Organization

By default, the plugin creates the following structure:

```
Your Vault/
└── Letterboxd/
    ├── posters/
    │   ├── The Matrix_1999.jpg
    │   ├── Inception_2010.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── The Matrix (1999).md
    ├── Inception (2010).md
    └── ...
```

This keeps all your movie data organized in one place while separating images into a subfolder.

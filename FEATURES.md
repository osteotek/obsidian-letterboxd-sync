## Core Functionality

### CSV Import
- **One-click import** from Letterboxd CSV exports
- **Batch processing** of multiple movies in a single import
- **Progress tracking** with real-time updates during import
- **Error handling** with detailed logging for failed imports

### Movie Note Generation
Each imported movie creates a markdown note with:
- Movie title and year as the heading
- Embedded poster image (optional)
- Structured metadata section with all available info
- Empty notes section for your personal thoughts

### Poster Management
- **Automatic download** of movie poster images from Letterboxd
- **Smart caching** - won't re-download if poster already exists
- **Organized storage** in a separate posters folder
- **Toggle option** to disable poster downloads if preferred

### Data Preservation
All data from the Letterboxd CSV is preserved in the markdown notes:
- **Date**: Original diary entry date
- **Name**: Movie title
- **Year**: Release year
- **Letterboxd URI**: Direct link to the movie page
- **Rating**: Your star rating (displayed with ‚≠ê)
- **Rewatch**: Indicator if you've watched before (shown with üîÅ)
- **Tags**: Converted to Obsidian hashtags (#tag-name)
- **Watched Date**: The actual date you watched the movie

## Smart Features

### Duplicate Detection

### File Name Sanitization
- Automatically handles invalid filename characters
- Replaces problematic characters (/, :, *, ?, etc.) with hyphens
- Ensures all generated files are valid on all platforms

### Tag Conversion
- CSV tags are automatically converted to Obsidian hashtags
- Spaces in tags are replaced with hyphens (e.g., "sci-fi action" ‚Üí "#sci-fi, #action")
- Makes movies easily searchable and queryable in Obsidian

### Folder Management
- Automatically creates output folders if they don't exist
- Keeps all movie notes organized in one location
- Separate folder for poster images

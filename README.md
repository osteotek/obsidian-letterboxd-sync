```markdown

- **Download images**: Enable/disable automatic poster image downloads (default: enabled)
- **Image folder**: Where poster images will be saved (default: `Letterboxd/images`)

## Privacy & Performance

- The plugin fetches poster images directly from Letterboxd's public pages
- No personal data is sent to third parties
- Images are stored locally in your vault
- Import is processed entirely on your device

## Troubleshooting

**Images not downloading**: Check your internet connection and ensure Letterboxd is accessible. Some corporate networks may block image downloads.

**CSV parsing errors**: Ensure you're using the official Letterboxd export format. Check that the file is not corrupted.

**Duplicate notes**: The plugin checks for existing files by movie name and year. If you want to re-import, delete the existing notes first.
